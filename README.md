DFU Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
This project implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using PyTorch Geometric and PyTorch Lightning to classify images as Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) or Non-DFU. The approach involves preprocessing images into graph structures using superpixel segmentation (SLIC) and Region Adjacency Graphs (RAG), followed by training a GCN model for binary classification.

Overview
The pipeline preprocesses images by:
-Resizing images to a fixed size (264x264).
-Segmenting them into superpixels using the SLIC algorithm.
-Creating a graph representation with nodes (superpixels) and edges (adjacency relationships).
-Extracting features such as mean color, centroid positions, area, and eccentricity for each node.
-Training a GCN model to classify the graphs as DFU (0) or Non-DFU (1).
-The model is trained using PyTorch Lightning with early stopping and checkpointing, and predictions are visualized with superpixel clusters and graph overlays.
